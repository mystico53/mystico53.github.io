        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">Welcome to Senaryon, a groundbreaking game engine I spearheaded at planpolitik, the
            leader in civic education in Europe. This innovative platform is the cornerstone of our transition to
            digital learning, enabling interactive, web-based workshops that have fundamentally changed how we teach and
            engage with students across the globe.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">My Role</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">As the architect of planpolitik's Online Education Department, I had the unique
            opportunity to build and lead a department from the ground up. My vision for digitizing collaborative
            learning formats was not just about keeping pace with technology—it was about leading the charge,
            particularly as we navigated the challenges of the pandemic.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Challenges & Solutions</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">The digital landscape posed a significant challenge: how do we replicate the richness
            of face-to-face learning in an online environment? The answer lay in the development of Senaryon. Through
            this platform, we've successfully digitized our company's signature teaching methods, enabling educators and
            students to create customized learning experiences.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Outcome & Impact</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">The launch of over 30 digital teaching tools, under my guidance, has positioned
            planpolitik at the forefront of online civic education. Senaryon alone has impacted 50,000 students in 1,000
            schools and 150 universities. Our efforts have been recognized with two international and four national
            awards, affirming our commitment to educational innovation.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Gallery/Case Study</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">A picture is worth a thousand words, and the success stories of Senaryon are best told
            through the visuals of our digital tools in action. Explore our gallery for a closer look at the platform's
            capabilities and delve into our case studies that document the journey and the transformative impact of our
            work.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Learnings</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">Each step in the development of Senaryon has been a learning opportunity. Embracing
            agile methodologies proved crucial, as did fostering a culture of problem-based learning. The collaboration
            across departments was not just beneficial—it was essential for the seamless integration of new features.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Technologies & Tools Used</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">The backbone of Senaryon's success was a suite of cutting-edge technologies and a
            commitment to agile project management. Our toolbox ranged from the latest in collaborative platforms to
            innovative project tracking software, all of which played a pivotal role in bringing our digital teaching
            methods to life.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Team & Leadership</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">None of this would have been possible without the talented team of 12 I recruited,
            including engineers, web designers, instructional designers, and QA experts. Managing a $2 million budget, I
            led the department in setting objectives, maintaining product roadmaps, and implementing company-wide
            processes that ensured a collaborative and efficient workflow.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Call to Action</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">I invite you to explore Senaryon and see the change we're making in the realm of
