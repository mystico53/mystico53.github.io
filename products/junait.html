        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">Introducing Junait, an innovative educational tool that I have had the pleasure of
            bringing to life. Designed to look and function like a social network, Junait is an interactive platform
            that educates elementary school children in German-speaking regions on digital literacy and internet safety.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Concept and Funding</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">The journey of Junait began with a vision to create a safe digital environment for
            children to learn about the perils of social media. My commitment to this cause was bolstered by securing
            $400,000 in governmental funding, which set the stage for Junait's development.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Team and Expertise</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">Building Junait was a collaborative effort. I brought on board a skilled web
            developer, a creative product designer, and a talented game designer. We also tapped into the insights of
            internet security experts and partnered with Thomas Feibel, a leading authority in digital literacy for
            children, to craft an engaging narrative.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Game Mechanics and Development</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">The mechanics of Junait were carefully wireframed to ensure an immersive experience.
            As the product manager, I steered the daily operations of a cross-functional team to turn these blueprints
            into reality. Our collective efforts were focused on designing interactive tasks that not only educate but
            also empower students to take charge of their online security.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Testing and Outreach</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">Before launch, Junait was rigorously tested with over 500 students, providing
            invaluable feedback that shaped the final product. I took the lead in creating compelling copy for the
            marketing website, ensuring that Junait's message was heard loud and clear.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Daily Use and Recognition</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">Today, Junait stands as a testament to innovation in education, with teachers
            incorporating it into daily lessons to promote awareness of online threats. The platform's success has been
            acknowledged with two national awards for its contribution to increasing online security.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Media Presence</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">The significance of Junait has been recognized by major publications such as Die Zeit
            â€“ Leo Zeit, Fachzeitschrift On!, and the Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband, highlighting the impact and
            importance of the platform in contemporary education.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Call to Action</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">Junait is more than a game; it's a movement towards a safer digital future for our
            children. I invite educators, parents, and institutions to join us in this crucial educational endeavor. To
            learn more, visit www.junait.de, and together, let's create a secure digital landscape for the next
            generation.</p>
