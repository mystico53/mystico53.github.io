        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            Embark on a journey through the intricate politics of the European Union with "Unionslabor," a compelling
            educational game that I have had the honor of developing. Designed to engage high school students in
            Germany, Unionslabor offers a hands-on experience of supranational governance, challenging players to make
            pivotal decisions as heads of government using their smartphones.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Funding and Conceptualization</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            The inception of Unionslabor was marked by a successful pitch that secured funding from prestigious
            institutions like the Bertelsmann and Heinz-Nixdorf Foundation. This financial backing was a vote of
            confidence in the game's potential to educate and inspire.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Development and Design</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            As the creative force behind Unionslabor, I crafted the Game Design Document and laid out the wireframes for
            the game mechanics. The 'Bring your own device' strategy was a deliberate choice to streamline the game's
            facilitation in classrooms, making the EU's complex decision-making processes accessible to all.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Team Assembly and Leadership</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            To bring Unionslabor to life, I assembled a dynamic team comprising a game designer, an author, an
            illustrator, two scientists, and an instructional designer. Together, we translated the intricate workings
            of the EU into an engaging game format, directed by my hands-on leadership.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Testing and Marketing</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            The game was refined through feedback workshops with 500 students, ensuring that the final product resonated
            with its target audience. My role extended to marketing efforts, where I created persuasive copy for the
            website and produced an attention-grabbing game trailer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Daily Integration and Accolades</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            Unionslabor has since become a staple in German-speaking classrooms, used daily to educate the next
            generation of EU citizens. Its impact has been recognized through shortlistings for both European and
            national awards.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Media Recognition</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            The significance of Unionslabor has not gone unnoticed, with features in major publications like
            Bild-Zeitung and Familie & Co, as well as coverage in influential blogs, highlighting its role in shaping
            how students perceive and understand the European Union.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-product-page">Call to Action</h3>
        <p class="p-product-page">
            Unionslabor is more than a game; it's an educational tool that brings the European Union to life. I
            encourage educators and students alike to explore the power and potential of this platform. For more
