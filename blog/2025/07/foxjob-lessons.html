            <h1>What if someone is always looking for the next job for you?</h1>
            <p class="post-date">August 2025</p>
            <p>Why did I start working on job recommendations? First of all, I was unemployed but c'mon, let's not
                overcomplicate it: Even though jobsearch is a complex process, the beginning is fairly easy: Reading the
                actual job description and deciding if it fits. Simple! Can you do that? Let's do a test:</p>
            <p>Imagine you're reading a job description, now how much intelligence do you use when answering the
                following two questions?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the requirements of the job?</li>
                <li>Can I deliver that?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I bet you just thought: "I can answer these questions without much effort". And you're right! The real
                pain as a job searcher is not reading one but dozens of job descriptions, every single day.</p>
            <h2>Learning 1: There are no incentives to write good job descriptions</h2>
            <p>Remember: You need to write your resume in a certain format, so that a recruiter can understand it within
                3 seconds -&gt; Company, Title, Duration, Bulletpoints ("Accomplished cool X as measured by metric Y, by
                doing sth Z).</p>
            <p>This clear universal format does not exist for writing job descriptions. This makes it much harder to
                read a lot of job descriptions than to read a lot of resumes. Today's job descriptions are a funnel of
                shame that could care less how much time job applicants spend on understanding what their job is about.
            </p>
            <div class="content-highlight">
                <strong>Common Job Description Issues:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full of generic industry lingo</li>
                    <li>Written by LLMs</li>
                    <li>Less than one sentence on what the company does</li>
                    <li>Unclear specifications and responsibilities</li>
                    <li>Unclear team environment and growth opportunities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p><strong>How I want job descriptions to look like, so that I can read them in 7 seconds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What the company does (All in one sentence: Context, Industry, Growthphase)</li>
                <li>My main responsibilities (Specific tasks, no "cross-functional communication" bs)</li>
                <li>Why I might be NOT considered (Missing domain expertise, certain certificate required..)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instead of whining about poor job descriptions: Let's ask LLMs to help us, cause that's where they
                SHINE:<br>
                LLMs understand meaning, not just keywords. They can deduct that "managing a development" counts as
                "leadership experience" and understand that "tracking KPIs" counts as "data-anaylsis".</p>
            <div class="content-highlight">
                <strong>How I planned to build an Agent that revolutionizes job recommendations</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read job postings</li>
                    <li>Match with resume and personal preferences</li>
                    <li>Receive only the jobs that are worthy for your eyes</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>So there you go, I started to develop a tool that automates that. Why? I believe the idea of creating
                truly trustworthy job recommendations is powerful. Active job seekers save at least 30 mins per day (or
                15+ hrs a month), passive job seekers are brought into the game, because they usually don't spend any
                time on job search. Might this be worth $6.99 if I can deliver on "actually useful job recommendations"?
                I decided to take the risk.</p>
