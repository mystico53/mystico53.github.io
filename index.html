        <h2>My ethos</h2>
        <p class="lead">As a product manager and leader I believe that having fun while
            building products is key. Products are more
            successful and personable if their development is a source of enjoyment for each contributor. That’s why
            a
            lot of my products work like games, instilling fun in students and teachers reflects back to the
            development
            team.</p>
        <h2>What I did so far</h2>
        <p class="lead">I worked 10 years at planpolitik where I digitized and scaled their face-to-face
            workshops,
            re-defining how
            civic education is done online. I created three software products from scratch, that reached more
            than 100
            000 students and won five international awards. In my last position at Freewire I directed 20
            engineers and
            two product teams to overhaul their multimillion dollar SaaS platform.

    <div class="my-products-container" id="scrollspyMyProducts">
        <h1>Products I've built</h1>
        <p>All of the following products are my creations. I envisioned the initial concept, pitched the idea to
            generate funding, hired teams, executed the development, tested and iterated on prototypes and MVPs. All of
            these products grow between 1.4x and 1.7x YoY - just by word of mouth.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="mt-4">Senaryon is a complex, multi-layered web application that I created to scale the company's
                face-to-face
                business model. It specifically targets schools and universities, enabling teachers, professors, and
                large institutions to autonomously facilitate complex workshops.
            </p>
            <p>
                After developing a highly succesful MVP within three months, I incrementally added core features to
                increase its ease of use, such as a real-time task system, a moderators area, a mobile friendly design
                system and interactive elements that improve immersion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Senaryon is a first-of-its-kind simulation engine of societal conflicts, which drew attention from
                educational researchers. They encouraged me to publish four peer-reviewed articles. I represented the
                product at 30 conferences and playtested face-to-face with 1000 students.</p>

                I partnered with Germany’s renown childbook author Thomas Feibel to create a compelling narrative. This
                narrative connects the technical features to the learning objectives. The network acts like a haunted
                house, infested by the evil Dr. Virus and filled with staged dangers like bots and viruses, designed to
                ensnare and deceive the students. They assist the cool hacker Condor, to turn the network into a safe
                place.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Unionslabor, (translated as EU-Laboratory) is a serious game I created for high-school
                students. It
                focuses on the art of governance while teaching conflict resolution and perspective taking skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a size of only three Megabytes, this mobile web-application allows students and teachers in any
                classroom to experience the beneficial effects of modern technology. The game format reflects our own
                use of technology, talking to eachother, while interacting digitally with our phones.
            </p>
            <p>
                My initial concept succesfully secured funding from two major German foundations. I designed all game
                mechanics, and created a team of game designers, EU-Policy Experts and Instructional Designers. A
                narrative with a wink ties policy domain knowledge to engaging interactions. This offers a welcomed
                package to teachers that want to connect technology, interaction and civic education. </p>
